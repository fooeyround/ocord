# Ocord

### Archived in favor of not using the discord client for now.

Ocord is only made to make it easier to launcher discord with `wofi`

### Requirements
- `discord` (Installed and in path, ocord wraps this command) 
- `electron_ozone` (can be found on the AUR)


### Check the issue tracker for known issues.
